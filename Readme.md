# Evidence I - Assembler Programming 

The present evidence demonstrates the algorithmization of a program logic exercise and its compilation in assembler using the [MASM32](https://www.masm32.com/) software for [32-bit architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/32-bit_computing).

It is worth mentioning that this tool is only available for Windows. Although assembly language can be written for multiple systems, the implemented program will only work on this platform.

The exercise consists of performing a summation over the elements of an array of integers located in odd positions with respect to this one.
